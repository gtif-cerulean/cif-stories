# CIF Capability: POLARIS – Helping Ships Navigate Safely in Polar Waters <!--{ as="video" mode="hero" src="https://dlmultimedia.esa.int/download/public/videos/2023/06/010/2306_010_AR_EN.mp4" }-->


## Background

As more ships travel through the Arctic and Antarctic, ensuring safe navigation in ice-covered waters has never been more important. The Polar Operational Limit Assessment Risk Indexing System—better known as **POLARIS**—is a tool approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to help mariners understand the risks posed by sea ice and make safer decisions on every voyage.

## Why POLARIS Exists

The Polar Code, adopted by the IMO in 2014, requires all ships operating in polar waters to carry a **Polar Ship Certificate**. This certificate outlines the ship’s limits for operating in ice, based on its structural strength and ice-class rating.

But polar ice isn’t uniform. Conditions can vary widely from place to place and day to day. POLARIS provides a practical way to assess how safe it is for a specific ship to operate in the ice conditions it faces, whether during voyage planning or in real time on the bridge.

## How POLARIS Works

At its core, POLARIS matches two things:

1. **The ship’s ice class**
2. **The surrounding ice conditions**, using standard national sea ice charts

POLARIS converts those inputs into a score called the **Risk Index Outcome (RIO)**. This score tells mariners whether the ship can proceed normally, should exercise caution, or should avoid the area altogether.

## Understanding the RIO Score

Each type of sea ice—new ice, first-year ice, multi-year ice, and so on—is assigned a number that reflects how risky it is for a certain ice-classed ship. POLARIS looks at:

- What types of ice are present  
- How much of each type there is  
- What the ship is built to withstand  

Using these factors, POLARIS produces a simple RIO value:

- **RIO ≥ 0:** Normal operation  
- **–10 ≤ RIO < 0:** Elevated risk (slower speeds or extra watchkeeping may be required)  
- **RIO < –10:** Operations should be avoided without special consideration  

POLARIS and RIO scores allow captains and voyage planners to make informed decisions based on real conditions.

## Who Uses POLARIS?

POLARIS supports several important needs across the polar marine community:

### 1. Voyage Planning
Shipping companies—such as **FedNav**, one of the world’s largest operators of ice-class carriers—use POLARIS to plan safe routes through ice.

### 2. Long-term Strategic Planning
Governments and researchers rely on POLARIS-based analyses to understand how accessibility changes throughout the year. For example, the **Government of Greenland** uses this information when studying new coastal activities such as carbon-sequestration projects.

### 3. Policy and Code Development
Organizations like the **Arctic Council’s PAME Working Group** work with the IMO to evaluate and refine how POLARIS supports safe operations and whether future updates are needed.

## What Data POLARIS Uses

POLARIS relies on national sea ice charts and ship-specific information. Key data sources include:

- **Greenlandic Ice Service** and **Canadian Ice Service** charts (which include essential “stage of development” details)  
- **Ship ice classification** from the vessel’s Polar Ship Certificate  
- **Seasonal information**, such as whether ice is decaying in summer  

An international initiative—the **Ice Logistics Portal**—is working to streamline access to these charts.

## What POLARIS Produces

Once the algorithm processes a sea ice chart, it calculates **RIO values for every ship class** across each region of the chart. These results can be displayed as:

- Vector or raster layers in dashboards  
- Map overlays showing areas suitable for different ice-class ships  
- Inputs to other decision-support tools, such as sea-ice datacubes  

On the **CIF Dashboard**, users can view:

- Sea ice concentration maps  
- POLARIS RIO results for different ship classes  
- Real-time or historical scenarios
