## The Cerulean Information Factory (CIF), a project funded by the European Space Agency, provides sustainabiliy-oriented decision support tools for the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean

Using satellite-based data, the latest in data processing and AI techniques, and a user-centric environment, CIF offers a cloud-based data analysis and visualization environment for your needs in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. 

Focused on shipping, aquaculture and offshore renewable energy, through close engagement with stakeholders in these three fields, CIF responds to your Green Transition decision-support needs. 

... [CA: add subhead or visualization to break this up.]

In the transition to create a sustainable world, how we view and understand the Earth are dramatically evolving with the ever-increasing availability of data, in particular from data collected from space. The European Space Agency (ESA) handles tens of petabytes of data, much of which comes by turning satellites downward, toward the Earth. With the acceleration of the development of AI techniques and cutting edge tools that decode that data into meaningful information, Earth Observation is helping us understand how our land, and our ocean, are changing. 

Taking satellite-based data and making into information that decision-makers can use to better inform their efforts to reach net-zero for communities, states, industries, marine protected areas, and more.

  <h3>Combining the Blue and Green Economies</h3>
  <p>Named for the blue-green colour, the CIF project reflects the need to combine the Blue and Green Economies in order to have a successful Green Transition.</p>

## CIF Domains
CIF's tools support the Green Transition in three key domains:

  <h3>Shipping</h3>
  <p>As global shipping continues to grow with increasing trade, and in parallel the International Maritime Organization (IMO), alongside countries and companies, work to decrease the carbon impact of the industry, while more possibilities open in shipping through the Arctic, CIF is responding by creating tools for minimizing a ship's carbon-intensity (an IMO-regulated index) and ice-informed route planning for safer, lower-emission voyages in the presence of sea ice and icebergs.</p>

  <h3>Offshore Renewable Energy</h3>
  <p>Off-shore renewable energy is poised to be part of the solution to Europe's ability to rely on green and domestic energy. On the other side of the North Atlantic Ocean, Canadian legislation is beginning the push to develop the industry, including joint federal and provincial legislation, including the governments of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. CIF's tools support the planning for off-shore renewable energy sites by providing multi-parameter site screening and monitoring across wind, wave, tidal, and solar energy.</p>

  <h3>Aquaculture</h3>
  <p>According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in 2022, global aquaculture production surpassed capture fisheries for the first time in recorded history, and 60% of fish consumed globally is projected to come from aquaculture by 2030. CIF is supporting this growth by providing tools for aquaculture site suitability and early warning signals (e.g., harmful algal blooms) to reduce risk.</p>

## Action toward the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development

<img src="https://cif.polarview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/UN-Ocean-Decade-Logo.png" alt="Ocean Decade logo" width="30%">

A contributor to the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (Ocean Decade), working towards ‘The science we need for the ocean we want’, CIF has been deemed an Ocean Decade Action in support of taking that critical step of translating scientific data into information and making it available to decision-makers.
