      <h3>Shipping</h3>
      <p>As global shipping continues to grow with trade and the opening up of more possibilities through the Arctic, CIF is responding by creating tools for carbon-intensity, ice-informed route planning for safer, lower-emission voyages in the presence of sea ice and icebergs.</p>

      <h3>Aquaculture</h3>
      <p>According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in 2022, global aquaculture production surpassed capture fisheries for the first time in recorded history, and 60% of fish consumed globally is projected to come from aquaculture by 2030. CIF is supporting this growth by providing tools for aquaculture site suitability and early warning signals (e.g., harmful algal blooms) to reduce risk.</p>

## Action toward the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science
## Ocean Decade logo <!--{as="img" data-fallback-src="https://cif.polarview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/UN-Ocean-Decade-Logo.png " src="https://cif.polarview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/UN-Ocean-Decade-Logo.png " style="width: 50%; height: 300px;"}-->
A contributor to the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (Ocean Decade), working towards ‘The science we need for the ocean we want’, CIF has been deemed an Ocean Decade Action in support of taking that critical step of translating scientific data into information and making it available to decision-makers. 

[note: can the decade logo be part of the same section as the decade title?]
