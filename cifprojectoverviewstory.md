 <h3>Combining the Blue and Green Economies</h3>
  <p>Named for the blue-green colour, the CIF project reflects the need to combine the Blue and Green Economies in order to have a successful Green Transition. 
Focused on shipping, aquaculture and offshore renewable energy, through close engagement with potential end users, CIF responds to your Green Transition decision-support needs. </p> 
	
	
	
In the transition to create a sustainable world, how we view and understand the Earth are dramatically evolving with the ever-increasing availability of data, in particular, data from space. 

With the acceleration of the development of AI techniques and cutting edge tools that take in data and create meaningful information, satellite-based data is helping us understand how our land, and our ocean, are changing. 

Using satellite-based data, the latest in data processing and AI techniques, and a user-centric environment, CIF offers a cloud-based data analysis and visualization environment for your needs in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.

Taking satellite-based data and making into information that decision-makers can use to better inform their efforts to reach net-zero for communities, states, industries, marine protected areas, and more. 

[note: need help with 'src' section of image tour â€“ where to put images and how to find them.

## CIF Domains
CIF's tools support the Green Transition in three key domains:

  <img src="https://cif.polarview.org/wp-content/uploads/bb-plugin/cache/Shipping-Icon-circle-d3dfaffc3b3ce792813de5d7fdd64fdf-hwxq58bkvn93.png"
       alt="Shipping example"
       width="15%"><br>
  <h3>Shipping</h3>
  <p>As global shipping continues to grow with increasing trade, and in parallel the International Maritime Organization (IMO), alongside countries and companies, work to decrease the carbon impact of the industry, while more possibilities open in shipping through the Arctic, CIF is responding by creating <b>tools for minimizing a ship's carbon-intensity (an IMO-regulated index) and ice-informed route planning for safer, lower-emission voyages in the presence of sea ice and icebergs.</b></p>
  <br>
</div>


<div>
  <img src="https://cif.polarview.org/wp-content/uploads/bb-plugin/cache/Renewable-Energy-Icon-circle-711dbfca50d8eec834610f8691ba58bb-uhf68rygbpqz.png" alt="Offshore Renewable Energy example" width="15%"><br>
  <h3>Offshore Renewable Energy</h3>
  <p>Off-shore renewable energy is poised to be part of the solution to Europe's ability to rely on green and domestic energy. On the other side of the North Atlantic Ocean, Canadian legislation is beginning the push to develop the industry, including joint federal and provincial legislation, including the governments of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. CIF's <b>tools support the planning for off-shore renewable energy sites by providing multi-parameter site screening and monitoring across wind, wave, tidal, and solar energy.</b></p>
  <br>
</div>

<div>
  <img src="https://cif.polarview.org/wp-content/uploads/bb-plugin/cache/Aquaculture-Icon-2-circle-1ab7fd53f927bbcab22dd8805ed3ffc8-zj8nguo6daly.png" alt="Aquaculture example" width="15%"><br>
  <h3>Aquaculture</h3>
  <p>According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in 2022, global aquaculture production surpassed capture fisheries for the first time in recorded history, and 60% of fish consumed globally is projected to come from aquaculture by 2030. CIF is supporting this growth by providing <b>tools for aquaculture site suitability and early warning signals (e.g., harmful algal blooms) to reduce risk.</b></p>
