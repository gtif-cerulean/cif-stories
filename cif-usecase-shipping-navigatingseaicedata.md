## Context and Problem
Ships voyaging through the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans — where they may encounter sea ice or icebergs — are required under the International Maritime Organization’s **Polar Code** to consult timely and historical ice information to plan the safest possible route.

Traditionally, this means relying on ice charts manually produced by national ice services. While these charts are authoritative, they are time-consuming to create, often low in resolution, and sometimes updated only weekly. Because they generalize conditions over large areas, they can miss critical navigational features like polynyas — narrow cracks in the ice that offer passage. Captains sometimes request raw satellite radar images (SAR) for more immediate and detailed insight, but these are difficult to interpret without training, as ice and rough seas can appear similar.

Navigating safely in the Arctic is high-stakes: a wrong judgment can lead to route delays, excessive fuel use, damage to the vessel, or in severe cases, becoming trapped. What’s needed is a way to bring all this information together — visual, expert, machine-interpreted, and regulatory — into one accessible tool that supports real-time, confident decision-making.

## Four-Layer Arctic Ice Intelligence

The **Cerulean Information Factory (CIF)** addresses this challenge by integrating four key layers of sea ice information into a single decision-support CIF Dashboard. This layered approach enables users to move between high-level assessments and detailed data, depending on their needs and level of expertise.

### Raw SAR imagery
Real-time radar images from satellites that offer weather-independent views of current sea ice conditions. These are valuable for visual confirmation but can be difficult to interpret on their own.
